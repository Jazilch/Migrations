* Install ZSH http://ohmyz.sh/ *

install via cURL
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

if this doesn't work then you can use 
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh

Use open /.zshrc in order to open up hidden files from the command line

* Cobalt2 Theme *
https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm

I would recommend cloning the entire repo with git clone https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm

Make sure when you're saving this it saves a document and not plain text. When I was setting the theme setting I would
try without quotations like the following ZSH_THEME=colbalt2

* Installing pip *
Wes Bos recommend going through the pip website in order install this but I found trouble with this.

I think the following was easier
sudo easy_install pip
