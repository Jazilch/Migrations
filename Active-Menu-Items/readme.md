Active Menu Items
A lot of times when customers come to HubSpot they want a way to highlight a particular menu item based on where they are in the website. 

We can do this by looking at the window.location object and then we can make sure that the that the current path of the browser pulled from the tab matches the href of the anchor tab of the item we want to match. 

Once we find this we will add a class of active to the menu item. All you will need to do is add your CSS with a class of active to the stylesheet and this will display properly.
